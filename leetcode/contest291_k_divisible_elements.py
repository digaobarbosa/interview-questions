"""
# Intuition
First solution I had was more of a brute force, where we iterate through all subarrays, created a string out of it to check if we have seen it before.

Inside this loop, I would iterate through the items in this sublist to count the number of divisible items.

There are other solutions like that on Leetcode

# Approach
Then to improve performance I had to avoid the two inner loops:
1 - iterating through the sublist to make a string key to the done set
2 - avoid the inner loop to count the number of divisible items


## 1. For the string key
This was easier (than item 2), just had to keep the str_key variable and create the key for the set each number at a time. So the key creation at each subarray wen from $$O(n)$$ to $$O(1)$$

## 2. Count of divisible items
The idea is to use a precalculation (DP) right at the start counting the number of divisible items seen on the array until so far.
I opted to make a array of len(nums)+1 so it could work even with start=end of array with the formula below.

count_divisors = div_nums[end+1] - div_nums[start]



# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(nÂ²)$$

- Space complexity:
$$O(n)$$
